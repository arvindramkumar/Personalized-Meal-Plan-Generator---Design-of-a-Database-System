# Personalized-Meal-Plan-Generator---Design-of-a-Database-System

Problem Description 

In the present day, eating Junk Food has become an integral part of any person’s diet, despite knowing the consequence. So, the very base plan was to select the best put of worst. There is an allowable calorie limit for every person based on his gender, age, kind of lifestyle. Based on this, depending on what meal and his restaurant preferences, we generate a list of food options that he could have without spoiling the entire diet.
